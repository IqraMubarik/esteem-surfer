Click, click - done.\n- [Blocktrades](https://blocktrades.us/) - a stable quick exchange run by one of the top Steem witnesses @blocktrades. We had opportunity to meet them during the SteemFest in Amsterdam and the SteemFest<sup>2</sup> in Lisbon. In addition to the ability to exchange Steem for few other coins you can also buy Steem account, Steem Power or even Steem Power delegation.\n- ~~[Changelly](https://changelly.com/)~~ - “temporarily” down, I’ve sent my offer to help them bring Steem back online. I got the first reply within less than 10 minutes. That’s promising. It has a nice feature that allows payments in USD via credit card, so bringing that back would be really nice.\n- ~~[ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.io/)~~ - “temporarily” down, I’ve sent my offer to help them bring Steem back online. I got the first reply in less than 6 hours even though it was a Saturday.\n\nNow I know why they call themselves “Quick”. ~~Poloniex on the other hand…~~\n\n#### Fully featured markets\nYou have much more choice here (alphabetical order), but things are more complicated. You need to deposit, then trade, then withdraw. Each of those actions may entail fees. Your orders may not always be matched. Etc.\n\n- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) - users have been able to trade Steem since February 2018, and it includes pairs with BTC and ETH.\n- [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/) - a reliable Steem market since forever.\n- [GoPax](https://www.gopax.co.kr/) - a Korean exchange that listed STEEM/KRW and SBD/KRW paris by the end of February 2018; along with Blocktrades, it can be accessed from the Steemit’s “hambruger\" menu.\n- [Huobi](https://www.huobi.pro/) - a Chinese based exchange that listed STEEM/BTC, STEEM/ETH, and STEEM/USDT by the end of April 2018.\n- ~~[Poloniex](https://poloniex.com)~~ I don’t even want to waste my time writing about it. Rumor has it that somehow they are blocked by the SpaceX mission to Mars (“there and back again”) and they won’t be able to support Steem again until then.\n- [Upbit](https://upbit.com/) - a Korean based exchange collaborating with Bittrex, trading Steem since early 2017.\n###### Warning: Do not keep your assets on exchanges, you risk when they fall or get hacked.\nBy the way: I would love to feature decentralized exchanges, but currently there are only two, both with negligible volume.\n\n### Steem.Chat\nBunch of upgrades and bug fixing.
