This includes all Steem and Steemdollars (SBD) but excludes curation rewards.\n\nWe have also made a graph, found here, https://www.brupvoter.com/#sponsors-roi .  This graph will tell you how much a delegator/sponsor will make per 1,000 STEEM POWER delegated to us on any given previous day, it is the blue bar.\n\nWhen you delegate Steem Power/SP to us, you will automatically be paid out earnings to your account by the next day at 08:00 GMT.  Remember not todays 08:00 GMT but the next days.  There must be a full day (24hrs) of delegation, to be compensated.\n\nAlso we have created a <b>STEEM POWER Delegation Manager</b> which makes it easy to delegate steem to us.  We use steemconnect to finalize how much Steem Power you want to delegate.  As a note if you delegate Steem Power to us, for instance, 500 Steem Power and you want to delegate 250 more Steem Power, you have to enter 750 Steem Power and NOT 250 Steem Power.\n\n<h2>Vote Buyers</h2>\n\nWe are the sustainable bot.  How does that work?  We have significant anti-spam features such as:\n- Blacklisting Bad Authors;\n- The post must be at least 30 minutes old;\n- Maximum 3.5 days old a post can be.\n\nYou will <b>never lose money with us</b>.  Our <b>ROI</b> (Return on Investment) is <b>at least 1%</b>, and at most you can make 10% in a 1 post period.\n\nOur website shows when the next round will be, which is at the left-top, ie, the timer countdown.  Furthermore, we calculate for you the \"Bid Return On Investment\" in a current round.  You can see this at the left-top of the website under \"Current Round.\"  Under Current Round we also calculate Total Vote Value, Weight of Vote, Total Bids, and Total Bid Value, for our vote buyers.  We also suggest for you the maximum value of your bid in order to have at least 1% of ROI, based on the prices of STEEM and SBD at the moment of the bid.\n\nWe work like other bots, whereby you send us SBD or Steem and in the memo you put down your link.  Then once the current round is over, we send you the upvote.\n\n<h4>We hope you enjoy our services!</h4>\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\nWe would like to thank all our spnosors (Steem Power delegators), for supporting us from the beggining to the present time.\n\nAlso, we would like to thank @yabapmatt for having created the <b><i>postpromoter</i></b> bid-based votting bot open-source code, which we also have contributed with code programming for bug corrections and new features, such as the max-roi settings.  We support him as a witness at https://steemit.com/~witnesses .\n\n<b>BR-UpVoter, march 7th, 2018 at steemit.com/@brupvoter</b>",
