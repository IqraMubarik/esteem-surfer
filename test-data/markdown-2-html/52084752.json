Analysts report that nearly 6 out of 10 corporations are considering application of this technology or already in the process of developing corporate blockchain services.\n\nEarlier, Cointelegraph reported that Microsoft and Amazon were considering the possibility of integrating blockchain technology into a number of their platform services. These are not the only cases where multinational corporations are making waves in the crypto space.
