Do you know what happens to your brain when you have a negative way of thinking?\n\nIn your brain there is a collection of synapses separated by an empty space. Every time a thought crosses your mind, synapses bond. Your brain physically changes in order to transmit an idea, so there is a big chance for a thought to repeat itself. \n\nImagine what happens if you’re always complaining. \n\n<center>![](https://steemitimages.com/DQmYytDL2UsSV2rBup66m7VnBPWrP71wMfZwZEJmihjgm4F/image.png)</center>[source](http://debuglies.com/2017/10/31/reports-brain-cells-are-made-of-less-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-than-other-major-organs-the-body/)\n\nIf you’re a negative person, you won’t just have negative thoughts when you have a problem, but you will also have them when you’re walking peacefully in the park. This is why it’s so important to stop complaining and start being more optimistic. \n\nTell me if you know something better than ***Steemit***. I am here to contradict you.\n\nThe thing is, you’re not only doing harm to yourself, but you’re hurting affecting others too. When you listen to someone who’s complaining, your brain tries to “reconstruct” what that person is feeling, and this is how bad thoughts can install in your mind. \n\nThe good news is that your brain can be remodeled, so it’s not the end of the world if you’re used to negative thinking. You can always exercise your way of thinking and bring positive thoughts into your brain and on ***Steemit***. \n\nStart taking care of your brain, your body, yourself and others and stop complaining. ***Steemit*** is simply beautiful if you allow yourself to see it.\n\n### And this is just the beginning...\n\n<center>![U5dtjrXYyNbAczMeScAsy84ErPFaojo_1680x8400.png](https://steemitimages.com/DQmUPvFMKhe3zgzDvJg5nxTLWAD38ntVQmvdMH3A8WhuvEH/U5dtjrXYyNbAczMeScAsy84ErPFaojo_1680x8400.png)</center>\n\n##### <center>-to be continued-</center>",
