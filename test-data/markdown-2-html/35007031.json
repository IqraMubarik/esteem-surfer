  "input": "Your eyes do not see. \n\nThey are organs which transmit light impulses to your brain. \nYour brain interprets these light impulses and with the input of other senses and experiences-stored, organizes them to form an *idea of consciousness*, equaling your reality. \n\nYour reality depends on what your brain  -You-  as it is instructed to perceive.  \n\nAs examples: \nThis is why one person is a great artist . . . able to capture color and shape and present them on canvas (or chosen medium) to facilitate a pleasurable response.  Because they \"see\" something others do not. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQcBQc3oaKg\nVideo from \"What the $^$&^ do we know\" movie.\nShamans not being able to see the ships . . . I don't know, I wasn't there.\n\nMy own example: \n\nMy co-workers could not find Five 4-thousand-pound-beams for construction.  They reported them missing.  I went to look and saw them immediately.  \"New eyes\" is the expression.  They had conditioned their brains to ignore these five beams  (Iron construction I- beams) ![steel-i-beam-lifted-by-a-crane.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmRDpPjBtPyc4gUzCrM33QM2LVWQ9r64TXJGHNfjBfzWGA/steel-i-beam-lifted-by-a-crane.jpg) ( image from the magic internet of images . . . I'm too lazy to be precise.)\n \n  Because they were not needed for months, when the time came to find them . . . their minds were conditioned to disregard these five beams.  \n\n\nQ. Did these five beams disappear?\nA. No . . . they were right there the entire time.\n\nQ. Were they invisible to the workers' eyesight?\nA.  Yes, The workers could no longer find them because they were dismissed by their collective consciousness. (The boss, the foreman, the 3 helpers.) \nAlthough, they were the first beams sitting in the Beam storage area. When the workers passed them, they 'knew' they did not need them.  Eventually, these five beams  *disappeared*. \n\nI saw them . . . because I'm strange that way.  I'm not the type who goes along with the crowd. \n\n\nQ.**What does this have to do with Prosperity Consciousness?**\n\nA. Prosperity exists all around us.  Not everyone can see it.  \n\nWhen you see it and understand it; you tap into prosperity and are able to use it.  \nThat is why I'm opposed to treating Voting power as something to be hoarded. \n\n2% . . . 5 % . . . promising a full percent as some kind of a reward?  \nThis limits the voters' perception.  IMHO. \nWhen you see and believe that prosperity is boundless and gifted to every one of us, if we only accept it, then to *Hold* an artificial limitation is ridiculous.   \n\nTo find Prosperity . . . Vote with 100%  . . . and worry not about tomorrow . . . you will have another vote.   \n\n\"To give\" is to prove to your mind that there is more than enough.  \nThen your mind finds more to give.  \nThat is why you have found this place. \nIt cost nothing to give. \nIt's a vote . . . Not a voting power. \n\n*I spent years wishing I could make a living on the internet; and then this place happened.*\nI believe it first . . . then it happened. \n\nThat is Prosperity Consciousness. \n\nIf you have questions . . . I will do my best to answer. \n\nH. G.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/2NYe752.jpg\nThis is what I do . . . I figure out how to do this.  \nI wonder:  *How did I get here?*\n\nDon't give me a full upvote . . . give yourself a full upvote by helping someone. Help someone believe this place is worth it.  It costs you nothing\n . . . unless you limit your vote. \nIf you think that you are diminished by voting, you are held back by an artificial limit created by others.  \n\n\nNo limits!\n\nBy the way, there is something going on at the sub-atomic level, namely with the Higgs-boson and the way that it interacts with energy.  \nOur thoughts are energy . . . the Higgs-boson collects energy into matter.  \nDo our thoughts collect into matter?  That's a topic for another post.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUzbmIKVAHo",
