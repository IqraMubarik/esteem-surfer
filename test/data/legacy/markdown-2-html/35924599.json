Every day women are called upon to selflessly meet the needs of their families. Whether they are awake at night nursing a baby, spending their time and money on less-than-grateful teenagers, or preparing meals, moms continuously put others before themselves.\" –\nCharles Stanley. Deep down I think this piece was subconsciously dedicated to my own mother. She is my rock and inspires me every day. \n\nAs artists I think we sometimes forget the importance of telling a story through our work. This can be more important than color choice, composition, subject matter… Really more important than anything! Even a poorly demonstrated work with an amazing visual story can still be successful. This dive deep into the psychological connection with what we see as \"art\". You can almost hear the mama bear explaining how to catch fish to her cub. I have always been guilty of Anthropomorphism : The attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. It is considered to be an innate tendency of human psychology. This piece definitely illustrates that.\n\n![Thumbnails__fishin_mock.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmVV5Tt4cDmKRj59iD9ALbH3bPqLKFw6VZgMCGvXCAQkQh/Thumbnails__fishin_mock.jpg)\n\n![Thumbnails__fishin_detail.jpg](https://steemitimages.com/DQmT74uGPnx2JTGZwzzLrTP2ef7h1Xz1d7mUvGMdBZxevqM/Thumbnails__fishin_detail.jpg)\n\nThank you for reading and please consider upvoting this post, following me, and leaving a comment.
